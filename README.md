# Image classification using Tensorflow

## Agenda

The agenda for image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) involves several key steps. Firstly, understanding the dataset and its labels to define the classification task. Preprocessing steps such as normalization and data augmentation enhance model performance. Next, constructing a CNN architecture comprising convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers tailored to the problem's complexity. Training the model involves optimizing parameters using gradient descent-based algorithms like Adam or RMSprop, with appropriate loss functions such as categorical cross-entropy. Fine-tuning hyperparameters like learning rate and batch size can improve convergence. Evaluating the trained model on a separate validation set helps gauge its performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Finally, deploying the model for real-world applications, considering computational resources and scalability. Regularization techniques like dropout and batch normalization can prevent overfitting, ensuring generalization to unseen data. Continuous refinement through experimentation and iteration fosters improved model accuracy and robustness.

## Problem Statement

Image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) involves developing a model capable of accurately categorizing images into predefined classes or categories. The task begins with collecting a labeled dataset consisting of images and their corresponding classes. The CNN architecture comprises layers such as convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers, designed to extract features and learn patterns from the input images. During training, the model adjusts its parameters through backpropagation, minimizing a predefined loss function. Data augmentation techniques may be employed to increase the diversity of the training set and improve model generalization. The trained CNN is evaluated on a separate test set to assess its performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. Applications of image classification using CNNs range from medical diagnosis and autonomous driving to facial recognition and object detection in surveillance systems.
